      Comparing Dominion avatars
    </h1>
    <p>
      Adam is the base Dominion avatar. Each later avatar has enhancements
      shown in the table. The effect of each enhancement can be seen in the
      charts.

      The first chart shows how each player performed in separate games against
      1-3 base (Adam) opponents. The bar labeled Adam shows how well the Adam
      avatar played against 1-3 identical players. There are equal numbers of
      2-player, 3-player, and 4-player games.
      The second chart shows how well all the players fared against each other.
      Every possible permutation was played, some multiple times to make
      the number of 2-player, 3-player, and 4-player games equal.

    <div id="explanation">
      <p>Win <span class=firstem>percentage</span> and win <span class=secondem>
        share</span> are slightly different, since a game can have more than one
        winner. Win <span class=firstem>percentage</span> is the fraction of all
        <span class=firstem>games</span> won by the player. Win
        <span class=secondem>share</span> is the fraction of all
        <span class=secondem>wins</span> claimed by that player. For a large
        set of games, the win <span class=firstem>percentage</span> is generally
        a few percentage points higher than win <span class=secondem>share</span>
        for each player.
